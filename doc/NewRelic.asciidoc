= Collecting Metrics with New Relic

https://newrelic.com[New Relic] is an observability platform, and is supported by OpenTelemetry through the OLTP/HTTP exporter protocol.
This document provides instructions on how to collect traces, metrics, and logs from a locally running Java app into New Relic.

== Create a New Relic Account

For this we are using a https://newrelic.com/signup[free] account.
Use the link to create an account.

== Determine the OLTP Endpoint

Once you have logged in, choose an endpoint from the table in the linked section of the https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/opentelemetry-setup/#review-settings[New Relic documentation]. There are servers for the US and for Europe.

== Copy the API License Key

With a base account, you have access to license keys through the account dropdown -> API keys. Find the key of type `INGEST - LICENSE`, and copy the value to the clip-board using the 'Copy key' option in the '...' menu.

== Start the OpenTelemetry Java Agent

Start the OpenTelemetry Java agent with the respective system properties:
[source,shell]
----
java -javaagent:opentelemetry-javaagent.jar \
     -Dotel.traces.exporter=otlp \
     -Dotel.metrics.exporter=otlp \
     -Dotel.logs.exporter=otlp \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.endpoint=[NEW RELIC SERVER]:4317 \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.headers=Api-Key="[LICENSE KEY]" \
     -Dotel.exporter.otlp.protocol=http/protobuf
     -jar target/myapp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

[NOTE]
The `NEW RELIC SERVER` is the endpoint URL provided by New Relic, and `LICENSE KEY` is the copied key.

== Viewing Data from the Application
From the `Browse data` dropdown select either `Traces`, `Metrics`, or `Logs`.

Note that there is some delay with New Relic processing ingested data, which can take up to a minute.

== Attribute Length Limitations

New Relic discards traces and events that have attributes which exceed their hard limit for attributes. In particular the max. attribute value length is 4095 characters, which can result in exception events being discarded if the `exception.stacktrace` attribute contains a stacktrace that is longer than that. Reference: https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/more-integrations/open-source-telemetry-integrations/opentelemetry/best-practices/opentelemetry-best-practices-attributes

For the New Relic integration we should document that the agent should be run with a respective attribute value limit: `-Dotel.attribute.value.length.limit=4095`, otherwise data such as exceptions might get lost. The setting causes OpenTelemetry to truncate attribute values to the limit. This also means that stracktraces can be cut off.
